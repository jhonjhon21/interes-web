            <h3> <p class="firstpar">Reason why i like him<br> </h3>
                <mark>He's the kind of player a lot of them wanted to be  </mark>... someone good at shooting, dribbling, and passing ... someone who looks cool doing those things. No one wanted to be a 3-and-D player as a kid.</p>
