            <p id="firstpar"><mark>Basketball</mark> is a simple game, where the main goal is to throw the ball in the basket more often than the opposition. You can shoot from anywhere, but shots inside the 3-point line the large semi-circle on each side of the court are worth 2, and anything outside is worth 3.:<br>
